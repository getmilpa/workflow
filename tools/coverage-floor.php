 * Coverage ratchet.
 *
 * Reads the Clover report PHPUnit just wrote and fails when line coverage drops
 * below the floor. The floor is not a target — it is today's number, so that it
 * can only go up.
 *
 * It exists because the measurement was in the toolchain all along with nothing
 * switching it on: xdebug installed, `<source>` declared in phpunit.xml, and
 * `coverage: none` in CI. A number nobody reads is a number nobody defends.
 *
 * Usage: php tools/coverage-floor.php <clover.xml> <floor-percent>
